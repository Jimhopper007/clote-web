      Do not go gentle into that good night, <br />
      Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br />
      Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br />
      Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <br />
      Because their words had forked no lightning they, <br />
      Do not go gentle into that good night.

      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
      species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
      junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is
      a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. <br />
      <br />
      Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
      their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for
      cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens are one of
      the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
      of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There
      are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous
      cultural references to chickens in myth, folklore and religion, and in
      language and literature.[citation needed]
